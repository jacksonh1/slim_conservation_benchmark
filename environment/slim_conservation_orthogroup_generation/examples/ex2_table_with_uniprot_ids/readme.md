In this example, I wrote a script to run the pipeline for some uniprot ids extracted from a table of potential "hit" sequences. <br>
I ran the following: <br>
```bash
python get_orthologs_from_table.py
```

I then mapped the results back onto the table and saved it as a new file. <br>
I did this in a notebook `./map_files_back_to_table.ipynb` to demonstrate.
