I downloaded the checkpoint from this link: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1hMAnXaPrK9HPzcC0RZ5d7zsw3IXN910f?usp=sharing <br>
and placed it here: `../../../data/DR-BERT.zip` <br>

I then unzipped the file and placed the contents in the `./data/DR-BERT` directory. <br>
with this command: <br>
```bash
unzip ../../../data/DR-BERT.zip -d ../../../data/DR-BERT
```
The checkpoint is too large to be included in this repository, so you will need to download it yourself. <br>
